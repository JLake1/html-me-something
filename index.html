Time to kick back and dig in to that classic lunch fare we all know and love: the iconic <strong>Sandwich</strong>. As a modern marvel of food construction and deliciousness, the only limitations are your imagination and what can fit between two slices of bread. Ranging from the humble cafeteria bologna and cheese to 5-star prime rib, from Jewish deli style to Vietnamese banh mi to Mexican tortas, sandwiches are enjoyed the world over in an endless array of variations. Here we'll be covering the history of the sandwich, its ingredients and styles, and finally some local St. Louis favorites.

<p>"Neccesity is the mother of invention." <br />&mdash;The Earl of Sandwich, probably</p>
</div>
<p>
While many cultures have arrived at their own version of the sandwich over the past few centuries, the most famous account of invention comes from its very namesake: John Montagu, better known as the Earl of Sandwich. Legend holds that Sandwich, an avid gambler, would play cards for long hours without wanting to break for a meal. So naturally, he wanted something that could be easily eaten by hand without dirtying the cards. The Earl came up with an ingenious solution: to order meat contained between two slices of bread. Others soon caught on and began ordering their meat "the same as Sandwich", and thus the sandwich was born.    </p>

<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>


<p>The construction of a sandwich can vary greatly, but the basic format calls for two slices of bread with various ingredients<em> sandwiched </em>in between. For brevity's sake, we will limit our discussion to &quot;traditional&quot; sandwiches (i.e. nothing open-faced, no &quot;is a hotdog a sandwich?&quot; consideration. </p><p>Below we'll go over the common ingredients you may find in a sandwich:</p>


<p><img src="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.206077236.6712/flat,550x550,075,f.jpg" class="image lt" /><strong>Bread</strong> &mdash; The most fundamental component of the sandwich. Both the container of the other ingredients and the first part one bites into, quality bread is key to a great sandwich. Popular types to use include sliced sandwich bread (white, wheat, sourdough, rye), sub rolls (also known as hoagie rolls), and sandwich rolls and buns (kaiser roll, onion roll, pretzel bun). Other less conventional types include bagels, biscuits, english muffins and croissants.   </p>
<p><strong>Cheese</strong> &mdash; As with the rest of the following ingredients, cheese is a very common ingredient, but not essential to a sandwich. Most sliced cheeses you'll find at the grocery or deli counter will work well on a sandwich, though overpowering or pungent cheeses are best avoided. Popular varieties include American, Swiss, Provolone, Cheddar, Pepperjack, Gouda, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>Meat, Poultry, Seafood</strong> &mdash; Sandwiches are often named by the meat they contain, as the main ingredient. Among the most common meats used are of the sliced deli variety, such as ham, turkey, roast beef, corned beef, pastrami and salami. Thicker cuts or pieces are also used, such as steak, fish, shrimp, and fried chicken.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetables</strong> &mdash; Vegetables are often used as complimentary ingredients, but can also serve as the main ingredient (such as eggplant parm or portabello mushrooms). As toppings, popular choices include lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, avocado and peppers.</p>
<p><strong>Condiments</strong> &mdash; While some sandwiches are served "dry", condiments are often the glue that ties it all together. They serve to enhance the flavor of the other ingredients and soften up the texture of the bread. Popular condiment choices include mustard, mayo, ketchup, ranch, sriracha and bbq sauce.</p>

<h2 id="types">Types of Sandwiches</h2>

<p>The types of sandwiches out there are simply endless. The traditional <em>deli</em> sandwich is among the most popular, often a sliced meat (or combo of meats) served on rye or sourdough with cheese and mustard or mayo. A classic variation on this is the <em>reuben</em> - usually corned beef, pastrami or turkey with sauerkraut and russian dressing. <em>Melts</em> are also a popular variety; they can describe most sandwiches with melted cheese. Philly cheesesteaks, tuna melts, and pizza subs can all be considered melts. </p>

<p>Speaking of melted cheese, any sandwich discussion would be remiss without the all-American <em>grilled cheese</em>. Another American staple is the <em>po' boy</em> - roast beef or fried fish or seafood on a baguette, served with LTO (lettuce, tomato, onion), pickles and sauce. Traditional fried chicken or fish sandwiches are popular as well, served with ranch or buffalo sauce (chicken) or tartar sauce (fish).

<p>Lastly, we must remember the <em>breakfast sandwich</em>. Toasted bagels, biscuits or english muffins may be filled with a hearty combination of eggs, cheese and breakfast meats (bacon, ham, sausage).
